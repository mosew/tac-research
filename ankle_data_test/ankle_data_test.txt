LINEAR OR SPLINE FIT?
	Gary's uses splines, so I should use splines?
	
REGULARIZATION CHOICE?
	Gary's finds optimal lambda
	Mine fixed 0.1. Maybe just use 0.1.

don't use?
error measures per episode
	peak height
	peak time
	AUC
	L2
	Linf
	
error measures per patient/device pair (training/test)
	averages computed over set of episodes per patient
		average peak height
		average peak time
		average AUC
		average Linf
		(average L2)
	parameters per patient/device pair
	
overall error measures (for a given set of hyperparameters, training/test)
	average peak height
	average peak time
	average AUC
	(average Linf)
	(average L2)
	distribution of estimated parameters
	
	


estimate using Gary's method for 6 splines per hour
	Single training episode each time
estimate using my method (simultaneous) for
	6 splines per hour, M=0
	single training episode
	i.e. direct comparison
	
	
	
then do the same for my improvements:
	M=0,1
	(2,4,) 6 splines per hour
	1,3,9(,27 if we have em) training episodes
	test on ALL NON-TRAINING episodes.
	------
	6 (9,12) paradigms results tables
	
	
	Tables:
		PER PATIENT
		One for each error measure
		Columns: hyperparameters/paradigms
		Rows: patients
		
		OVERALL
		One table
		columns: hyperparameters/paradigms
		rows: error measures
	
	
	Plots:
		Choose a few "test episodes" at random BEFORE everything
		For each of these test episodes,
			1 figure, actual BrAC plot against estimated BrAC for each(?) hyperparameter paradigm.
