OVERHAUL OF CODE

Notes:

	Length of a certain episode will be uniform between BrAC and TAC.
	If the maximum BrAC/TAC timestamp of an episode exceeds the maximum TAC/BrAC timestamp
		then the longer one will be truncated ?? and fit to the end of the shorter one by interpolation
	
	

forward dynamical system simulation:

	input
		-u
			ni x 2 ARRAY
				BrAC samples
					First column is timestamps of samples in HOURS
					Second column is BrAC reading in PERCENT				
				
			**Any pre-processing of BrAC signal, like linear interpolation or fitting to a spline, is done elsewhere.
				
		-q1M
			(M+1)x1 ARRAY
				M will be deduced from length of q1M
		-q2
			NUMBER
		-tau
			NUMBER
				timestep length of corresponding discrete dynamical system
		-N
			NUMBER
				approximation of infinite-dimensional dynamical system by matrices of size ~N
		-P
			NUMBER
				Simulated output mesh size
				the number of splines per hour to fit the output signal to.
			
			
	output
		-Simulated TAC
			ni x 2 ARRAY
				ni is the number of input (BrAC) samples.
