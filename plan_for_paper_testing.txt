PLAN FOR NOT OVERHAUL


for each paradigm
	collect per-episode and overall mean and var of 
		peak height error
		peak time error
		Linf error
		L2 error
		AUC error
		
dataG_episodes[train,test] a struct of per-episode mean/var of ^^
dataG_overall a struct of overall mean/var of ^^
dataMe_1train_episodes[trainingind,test] a struct of per-episode mean/var of ^^
dataMe_1train_overall
dataMe_2train_episodes[trainingind,test]
dataMe_2train_overall
?? dataMe_4train_episodes[trainingind,test]
?? dataMe_4train_overall
dataMe_8train_episodes[trainingind,test]
dataMe_8train_overall



for each "me"
	M = 0 (or 1 ?)
	P = 2 spl/hr only?
	lambda = 0.1
	
Training/testing
	Train Gary on i, test on j
		9*9 = 81
	Train each me on i, test on j
		9*9 = 81
	Train each me on each pair, test on j
		36*9 = 324
	Train each me on each set of 4, test on j
		504*9 = 4536
	Train each me on all but j, test on j	
		9*9 = 81
