tests:

test prepare_data.
maybe figure out better windowing
Figure out and fix TAC de-noising schema.
pad episodes at beginning?


test episode i
1) training: i only
2) training: all
3) training: all except i

33 total.

one table for each tau and spline type

Each of 1),2),3)

	Varying M,P,tau. Maybe not N or tau?
		M ranging 2^(0:5)
		P ranging 2^(2:6)
		tau = 1,5
		Gaussian splines as well as linear?
	Testing all combinations: 6*5 * 2*2? = 120 (N fixed).
	
	Table for fixed tau, spline type:
		M by P, each cell has data below.
	
	Data to collect for each
		L2 MSE: training error and test error (MSE and sd across all possible training/test episodes)		
		Linf error: training error and test error (mean and sd across all possible training/test episodes) 
		error in AUC: training error and test error (mean and sd across all possible training/test episodes) 

		peak time error: training and test, each episode. also mean and sd.
		peak height error: training and test, each episode. also mean and sd.

		all errors over time
		
		parameters q (for each)
		
		
		
Findings: Peak height and peak time estimates don't really depend on M.
Linf error depends marginally on M, but less and less so as training corpus grows, as expected.
	To show, give log10(sd/mean), relevant for MSE since it is positive.
	this will give difference in magnitude b/w sd and mean
	Give variance of errors over M=0,2^(0:5) as well as episodes 1:11.
	
Also plot errors
	
~15-minute grid seems to work best for these error measures
